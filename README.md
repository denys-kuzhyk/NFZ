# NFZ
Object Oriented Programming Project

Hello there!

This little project represents a simplified healthcare system with patients and hospitals.

It basically tracks all the main processes in it, for example how many patients in a hospital, list of diseases, diseases statistics, list of hospitals etc. 
You can also make changes to the system, like add a particular hospital or a patient to a hospital, add a disease to a patient and many others.
I used the pickle library here to push the objects into a dat file, I think it's pretty useful here and easy to operate.

I was writing this program to exercise my OOP skills, but it really came to the point where I thought it could be in my portfolio here on GitHub.
I tried to comment and explain all the functions and unclear moments, so I hope my code won't be hard to understand :)

Thank you for taking the time to check it out!
